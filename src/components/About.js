          <p>Below are high level goals that I want to learn during this challenge.</p>
          <h3><a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a></h3>
          <p>
              This web application is built on React library and started with create-react-app utility.  
              There are improvements that should be made to this site and to my casual fan horse racing 
              site <a href="https://landsharkpark-mn.firebaseapp.com/" target="_blank"> LandShark Park</a>.
              While not major changes expected, I would like to learn more about React Context API and Redux.
              And I have a few more pages to complete on 
              <a href="https://landsharkpark-mn.firebaseapp.com/" target="_blank"> LandShark Park</a>.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h3><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a></h3>
          <p>
              My first and only experience with Docker was during a   
              <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/gradsoftware/current/courses/" target="_blank"> DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure</a> 
              course at the <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/gradsoftware/" target="_blank"> University of St. Thomas</a>.  
              Oustanding class - I would highly recommended for any IT Professional to take this course - whether in a degree 
              program or as an audit.  
          </p>
          <p>
              So much buzz in the industry involving containers...  I want to learn more.  Side projects are my only option 
              these days - it would likely be a very long time before my current employer's applications are moved to containers.    
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h3><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Kafka</a></h3>
          <p>
              I know the theory with pub/sub messaging systems.  I want to set up and code some examples.  
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h3><a href="http://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Spark</a></h3>
          <p>
              For this 100 Day Code Challenge, my Apache Spark journey will likely just be setting up a system 
              and coding some small examples.  The second half of 2020 I'm planning 100 Days of Maching Learning Code Challenge 
              where I will focus more on machine learning design.  
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h3>My "Planned" Structure</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>10 Sprints for 100 Days of Code Challenge</li>
              <li>10 Days of Coding per Sprint</li>
              <li>Sprint Planning - State high level goal(s) to accomplish during Sprint</li>
              <li>Sprint Review - Quick notes for lessons learned, accomplishments</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              Note: The added "Agile format" is not meant to distract from coding exercises in the 
              100 Days of Code Challenge.  Sprint Planing and Review are meant to be short, quick 
              notes.  Agile format would help me set short term goals in addition to formatting 
              organized journal entries for public posting.
          </p>
          <h3>Final Thought</h3>
          <p>
              There is a better chance of me finishing this challenge than that whole "healthy eating, exercise 
              and just be a good person" resolutions that seems to pop up around this time of year.  However I'm not 
              legally obligated to finish this challenge.  If I'm not having fun with this challenge, I'll quit.  
              That is the way I roll.  Thanks for stopping by - Have a great day!
          </p>
