          Just sharing a couple notes from my first 100 Days of Code Challenge.  My first 100 Day 
          Code challenge was beginning of 2020.  I should write a 
          blog post with some more information some day, but this will have to do for now.  
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Good => benefits, experienced gained from first 100 Days of Code Challenge </strong>   
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Having a project and goals to keep motivation up</li>
          <li>This site and the Agile format did organize some thoughts and work throughout the challenge</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <strong>Needs improvement => next 100 Days of Code Challenge  </strong>   
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Limit challenge to a couple specific technologies</li>
          <li>This site and the Agile format did organize some thoughts and work throughout the challenge</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br></br>
      <p>I'm a news junkie, so the coronavirus health pandemic and financial news of early 2020 was distracting for 
        me.  As a result, I skipped several days here or there from the code challenge.  I need to do a better job 
        of balancing daily time and effort to the code challenge.
